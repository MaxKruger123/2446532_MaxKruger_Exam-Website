            <p>Development of my site:

                Since week 10 I have been including lots more javascript for DOM manipulation and buttons. Creating buttons requires less html since I do not have to use tags anymore but I can rather use DOM manipulation to replace the page when the button is clicked. I have also included CSS on the JS buttons for responsive design. I change the cursor when users hover the button to a pointer so that they know it can be clicked on and I created a golden border around the button using :hover so that I can edit the elements of the button. The JS buttons have made my html code far more simple and have made alignment through CSS easier too.
                
                <br/><br/>As far as my website goes in terms of responsive design, it needs a lot of improvement. One of these previous weeks Andre spoke about using percentages, em and other units rather than pixels when creating a flexible design. Looking at my website now I understand far better what I have to do in order to develop my site so that it responds well with other devices and not just a computer screen. I feel that it is extremely important to have a responsive design especially in our country. The digital divide has caused the majority of the local population to access the web through their phones or tablets. Therefore it is important for me to further develop my website so that it responds well with other devices. I think that this is challenging though because as a web developer you are building a website to run on another person's machine and you may have no idea of their specs. Only estimations. 
                
                <br/><br/>However, I do think that the benefits of having a responsive design are well worth it. Having a responsive design enables more people to have a far better experience on your website. The better the experience users have the more likely they are to come back.
