            <h1>  <span id="Week9heading">Week 9 - Developement of CCS skills</span></h1>
            <p>With the development of our CSS skills I realised a huge mistake in my website that definitely costed me marks. My assignment 1 wasn't scalable to an mobile phone. When adjusting the screen size my containers and text did not scale properly and above all my header too. With the recent lectures on CSS I started understanding how to make my website more manageable and traversable on different screen sizes. This week I have been tweaking my containers, font sizes and much more to make sure that when the screen size is different then everything on the site remains consistent and scales with the screen size. Later during the week I will create a button for mobile devices that brings up a menu to replace the header. However, I previously had the issue where the menu would appear behind everything on the website. I will try to work on this and fix it.

                In "Digital Inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence and big data", Lutz explores the unequal distribution of benefits that come with modern technologies in the context of artificial intelligence and big data. Lutz highlights the importance of the unequal distribution by stating that "Access to the internet" is an "essential condition" in order to distribute the benefits that come with the digital age.
                
                In the text Lutz also notes that "Digital Literacy" plays an essential role in shaping the digital divide. People who lack the skills to properly use modern technology will not reap the benefits of it either. The author emphasises the importance of having digital literacy with regards to AI and big data. Without the skills to properly analyse and interpret data, individuals face a disadvantage in accessing the opportunities these technologies provide.
                
                Furthermore, Lutz raises concerns with regards to biases and discriminatory outcomes that may unfold with AI and big data. The text states that AI and big data can create "new forms of discrimination and inequality"  if the AI reproduces existing biases and discriminations.
                
                The algorithms used in AI collect data for analyses. This data can be influenced by societal biases. The author emphasises the need for transparency in these AI systems and the need for developers to to prioritize fairness and consider ethical concerns in their design.
