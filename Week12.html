            <p>Reflection on reading:

                The reading by Costanza Chock on “Traveling while Trans” critiques the many norms and assumptions made by designers that creates issues for marginalized groups (Chock, 2020).  The author starts by reflecting on their trip back from a conference where they had to pass through a millimeter scan at the airport that is designed for Males and Females only. They state that each interaction with airport security is designed “based on the assumption” that there are only 2 genders (Chock, 2020). 
                
                They then explain “The Design Justice Network” that has set a goal to go beyond the norms of design that are inclusive to the majority but to rather push the limits of design to attempt to include minorities and marginalized groups too (Chock, 2020). The idea is that the current design philosophy frames of “social impact design” or “design for good” are not good enough and need to be expanded to become more inclusive to these marginalized groups (Chock, 2020).
                
                <br/><br/>API’s on my Website:
                There are 2 Api’s that I could envision having on my website, 1 that has an open video game database where I may be able to say whether I have played the video game or not. It may be a fun way for users to test my knowledge on video games. The other relates to my love for esports. Under my passions heading in my portfolio tab I could have a layout that displays the upcoming matches I will be watching. Honestly, I think it will be challenging to implement an API onto my website considering that I have never attempted it. I feel it will be challenging to display live or upcoming matches on my website with the space it requires. I also do not want it to be the main focus of my site so I do not want it to be too large and overbearing.
