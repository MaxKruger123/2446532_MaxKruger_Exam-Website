            <h1>  <span id="Week7heading">Week 7 Website Development Blog - IxD Process</span></h1>
            <p>
                My Website:

                This week was a tough one for me because I had to almost completely restart my website. I felt that I didn't have a good wireframe or realistic approach to my website. So I decided to re-do my my initial wireframe and completely change my website to suit it. This was difficult at first because it felt like so much work went down the drain but after a while I realised that it really was the right decision.<br/><br/>
                
                IxD Process:<br/> <br/>
                
                Information Hierarchy - I have managed to create mind maps of each main screen and the elements that go underneath of them. The information Hierarchy for my website is quite simple and does not go too deep. My most complex is my blog section which has 5 nav elements on the same level of the hierarchy that all go to another page. My Home Page contains a nav element that has an Image of myself, an heading and a small description of who I am and what my website is about. My blog section as said before has 5 articles that all lead to their own individual pages. My Design section is the biggest page that contains my entire IxD process, style guide, wireframes and descriptions of my website.<br/><br/>
                
                User Flow - My Home Page gives a brief introduction to me and my website and then lets the user go to my portfolio. My portfolio Section is incomplete but it does lead to my blog section. At the bottom of my blog section the user is asked if they want to learn more information about the creation of the website which will lead them to my design section. Finally, the essay section is blank so the user will not be sent there.<br/><br/>
                
                Reflection on reading:
                
                After a bit of extra reading for the reading given to us I found that the author proposes a a framework in order to study UX that focuses on 4 key dimensions: The hedonic quality which is the emotional appeal for a product eg. you feel a want for an new iPhone. Second is the pragmatic quality which leans on the products usability or functionality. Cognitive quality which goes into how the product supports the users cognitive processes and lastly, the products cultural and social values (how the products shapes the social norms). It all makes sense to me why digging into emotions, motivations and cognition is an important aspect when designing an user experience. I also really liked the idea that this reading presented which was where the authors argues that UX is a consequence of interaction between three contributors: object, user context. I greatly agree with this understanding of UX since without these a user experience doesn't feel whole.</p>
