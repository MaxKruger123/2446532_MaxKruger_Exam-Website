            <h1>  <span id="Week3heading">Week 3 Website Development Blog - CSS and UI/UX</span></h1>
            <p><br/><br/>Development of CSS: This week I began my adventure with CSS which at first made a lot of sense to me. However, after attempting the exercises given to us I quickly realized how complex a website that seems so simple could be. I have taken a look at Apple's website and had a sneak peek at its CSS and honestly some of it made no sense to me at first glance. However it also inspired me to hopefully make something great for my website too. CSS is about what I expected it to be. It aids in creating something that the user feels they can easily engage with. It almost welcomes them to click on anything they want and without it people wouldn't trust your service, the content or really anything that you provide as value on your website. On how I am doing with CSS though, I feel like I am progressing at a good pace but I am still nervous about how my website might turn out but I am trying my best to be confident in my work and I am looking forward to learning JavaScript.

                <br/><br/>Reflection on Lecture content and UI/UX: After watching the lecture content for this week on UI/UX and how Norman doors are a problem, I understand better how this links to convention and the www in context of website development. In my time I have been to plenty websites where it just didn't give off the "vibe" I wanted so then I would basically instantly click off and go find another source. But this "vibe" wasn't just a "vibe"  it was the lack of convention used within the creation of the website and bad UI/UX that influenced my click-off. After reading "Convention and Context" by Mailloux, my understanding of convention as a definition was expanded as now I view convention as individuals coming together to share a common practice. In context of website creation which I think is the core component of this course I see convention in a lot of the websites I visit. An example is usually that the logo of the brand's website is in the top left hand corner of the website and can also usually be clicked on to go back to the homepage.
                
                <br/><br/>Supplementary Usefulness: I quite like the supplementary material provided this week. Since it is an older lecture it provides some different perspectives on interactivity that we also used in our class. After watching the lecture by Raheel on interactivity I liked the view that old researchers had on the present day and how an image of the Memex was an prediction of how we may one day be able to work with, read, and refence multiple completely different texts at the same time. The most interesting part is how accurate the Memex prediction was.</p>
