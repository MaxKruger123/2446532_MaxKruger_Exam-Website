            <h1>  <span id="Week13heading">Week 13 Blog Post -  Reflecting on the Digital Divide</span></h1>
            <p>The Digital Divide Widens Reflection:

                The text starts by stating that due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the education system has been disrupted. Because of COVID, most schools have resorted to online learning which is problematic for students in “Sub-Saharan Africa” (Glynos, 2020). Furthermore the text gives a shocking statistic that 50% of students do not have access to a computer and 82% of these students are unable to go online due to no internet access at home. This threatens to widen the gap between those with and without access because the lack of access is “disproportionately“ affecting disadvantaged students (Glynos, 2020).
                
                <br/><br/>Moreover, the text explains how this not only disproportionately affects students but also less privileged workers. Teleworking or working from home is an option that only a small minority have. Remote interaction for work is only available to 29% of Americans which secures their job. Jobs which require individuals to interact with one another or be in proximity of each other are economically threatened and restricted. 
                
                <br/><br/>Employees that cannot afford to work at home or simply lack the means are extremely vulnerable to the digital divide widening because “concerns are expressed that social distancing might “widen existing disparities” in terms of income inequality and wealth distribution (Glynos, 2020).
                
                <br/><br/>The final point of the text states that we should “sustain” our efforts and try to “provide access to all” otherwise we will have a highly unequal world (Glynos, 2020).
                
                <br/><br/>Reflection of Internet Access is a Fundamental Right:
                
                <br/><br/>The text begins by stating that internet access is a right that is recognized by the “United Nations” and “Amnesty International”. In 2021 the Indian Supreme Court has also “declared” internet access as a fundamental right (Kasapis, 2020). The author states that due to COVID-19, this view has become “strengthened” and that internet access should be free to everyone (Kasapis, 2020). 
                
                <br/><br/>The pandemic has caused social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus which has also intensified digital activity all over the world. Individuals who do not have access to the internet cannot participate in this new digital age that is flourishing. The author mentions that these people are not only unable to sell or buy goods but they cannot work.
                
                <br/><br/>Furthermore, this increases the gap between economic inequalities. The text raises a concern that half of the world population do not have equal access to “education, health and the labor market.” Billions of people are denied access to and participation at the most “mainstream medium” (Kasapis, 2020).
                
                <br/><br/>Lastly the author raises two concerns for the ongoing future post pandemic that are whether or not all citizens should have access to the internet for free and the second is if all citizens are to have free internet, is it the government's job to do so? (Kasapis, 2020)
