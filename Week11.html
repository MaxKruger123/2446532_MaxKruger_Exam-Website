            <p>Website Development:

                This week I have tried to find ways of incorporating javascript into my website to include some button functionality. First I wanted something a bit fun on my website. Initially I had a quote from myself on my homepage, but now I have an JS script with an array of quotes from myself that when the user presses the button “Generate Max Quote”, It finds a random quote and displays it on the page. This was basically what we did in one of our first javascript practical lectures but I still wanted something that could reflect my fun personality on my website so I wanted to include it. 
                
                Secondly, I changed the links for my Blogs page into buttons. They now use DOM manipulation to replace pages. This makes my code far less messy and represents the different weeks better than before. Lastly, I have made my back button an actual button rather than a tag. This again simplifies my code and makes it much easier for users to see that it is clickable due to the :hover tag that I can use with a button to highlight it with a border.
                
                <br/><br/>Reading Reflection:
                
                The reading “The Road to Technolonialism” speaks about the control that China and the US have of AI over developing countries. It also talks about how problematic this may be for the developing countries who seek aid from the US and China to develop their use in AI but with political and economic gain for the AI superpowers (China and the US).
                
                The Test first explains the powers of the US and China through “GAFAMI” (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM) and “BATX” (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi) (Verdi, 2021). The text states that these powers have 3.3$ trillion market capitalization compared to the EU with only 1$ Billion  market capitalization (Verdi, 2021). This was surprising to me at first but I quickly realized that I used almost half of these US companies' tech in my daily life.
                
                Furthermore, the text reveals the “geoeconomic potential of AI” (Verdi, 2021). Verdi states that for access to AI for developing countries, China and the US will ask for “political and economic gains” (Verdi, 2021). Moreover, Verdi reveals that the US Dominates 82% of the digital advertising space in South Africa. This was a shock to me. Without realizing it I use Google, Facebook, instagram everyday. I understand better how the US has take control over the digital space in our country and I better understand the digital divide we live in today.
