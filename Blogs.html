                    <p>Setting Up GitHub: In the first week we were introduced to GitHub Desktop. At first it was a bit confusing since it is a new program we are using but I'm sure as we continue using it throughout the course it will get easier... </p>

                    <p>HTML: Thanks to high school I had already gained experience with html using basic tags to create small websites. At first when I heard we would be using html I was excited!</p>

                    <p>Development of CSS: This week I began my adventure with CSS which at first made a lot of sense to me. However, after attempting the exercises given to us I quickly realized how complex a website that seems so simple could be</p>
                </button>
                
                <button class="Week4" onclick="week4Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 4 Website Development Blog - My First WireFrame</span></li>
                    <p>Experience Developing my site: My first wireframe of my website was quite messy since I wasn't completely sure what was important when creating a website, I hadn't given UX a thought and nor did I think to myself to set a realistic wireframe. By realistic I mean someone creating their first website.</p>
                </button>

                <button class="Week7" onclick="week7Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 7 Development</span></li>
                    <p>This week was a tough one for me because I had to almost completely restart my website. I felt that I didn't have a good wireframe or realistic approach to my website. So I decided to re-do my my initial wireframe and completely change my website to suit it. </p>
                </button>

                <button class="Week8" onclick="week8Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 8 Development</span></li>
                    <p>Overall, creating my first website was lots of a fun and was an great learning experience. However, I had one persistent problem that I definitely would change if I had the time to go back. </p>
                </button>

                <button class="Week9" onclick="week9Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 9 Development - CSS</span></li>
                    <p>With the development of our CSS skills I realised a huge mistake in my website that definitely costed me marks. My assignment 1 wasn't scalable to an mobile phone. When adjusting the screen size my containers and text did not scale properly and above all my header too</p>
                </button>

                <button class="Week10" onclick="week10Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 10 Development - JavaScript</span></li>
                    <p>This week I have tried to find ways of incorporating javascript into my website to include some button functionality. First I wanted something a bit fun on my website. Initially I had a quote from myself on my homepage, but now I have an JS script with an array of quotes from myself that when the user presses the button “Generate Max Quote”, It finds a random quote and displays it on the page.</p>
                </button>

                <button class="Week11" onclick="week11Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 11 Development - Responsive Design</span></li>
                    <p>Since week 10 I have been including lots more javascript for DOM manipulation and buttons. Creating buttons requires less html since I do not have to use tags anymore but I can rather use DOM manipulation to replace the page when the button is clicked.</p>

                <button class="Week12" onclick="week12Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 12 Development - Thinking about API's</span></li>
                    <p>The reading by Costanza Chock on “Traveling while Trans” critiques the many norms and assumptions made by designers that creates issues for marginalized groups (Chock, 2020).  The author starts by reflecting on their trip back from a conference where they had to pass through a millimeter scan at the airport that is designed for Males and Females only.</p>

                <button class="Week13" onclick="week13Click()">
                    <li><span>Week 13 Development - Reflecting on the Digital Divide</span></li>
                    <p>The text starts by stating that due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the education system has been disrupted. Because of COVID, most schools have resorted to online learning which is problematic for students in “Sub-Saharan Africa” (Glynos, 2020).</p>
