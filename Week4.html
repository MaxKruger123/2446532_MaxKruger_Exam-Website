            <h1>  <span id="Week4heading">Week 4 Website Development Blog - My First WireFrame</span></h1>
            <p><br/><br/>Experience Developing my site: My first wireframe of my website was quite messy since I wasn't completely sure what was important when creating a website, I hadn't given UX a thought and nor did I think to myself to set a realistic wireframe. By realistic I mean someone creating their first website. I immediately looked at Apples website and though hmm I like this and thought of a way to include some awesome effects that apple had with my website. But I forgot that this was probably quite unrealistic and it was. As I started developing my website it became incredibly messy and it didn't feel like a website that was easily traversable. So I made my first important decision to start focusing on the travers ability of my website first rather than cool effects that can cause users to get lost.

                <br/><br/><br/>My Wireframe compared to the readings: As mentioned above my wireframe felt quite messy, and my objective at the time was very blurry but was more toward making everything look cool. After the reading on UI and the basic principles, I found exactly what I was missing in my wireframe, a strive for clarity. The reading states to avoid anything that confuses the user and I managed to do exactly that. I needed to make something simple that is consistent throughout my website that gives the user the accessibility they need to traverse my website. So I decided to basically completely scratch my first prototype of my wireframe and to create a more refreshing, simple design that accomplishes these goals. 
                
                <br/><br/><br/>UI and interactivity: UI and interactivity are closely linked. A UI is by nature interactive as it is responsive and does not respond in a completely random fashion. That is if the UI is not a terrible one. Something is also interactive if it requires non-trivial effort and if a UI is designed well then traversing it should require little to no effort.
                
                Reading reflection: This week's readings opened my eyes more as to what a website really is and key concepts that go into creating one. The fact that it is all about navigating between information has now become the backbone to my wireframe and website. It has put me on the right track to developing my website and gave me concepts that I am able to constantly refer to during my development cycle.</p>
