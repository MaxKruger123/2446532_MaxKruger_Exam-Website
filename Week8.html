            <h1>  <span id="Week8heading">Assignment 1 Reflection</span></h1>
            <p>Assignment 1 Reflection: Overall, creating my first website was lots of a fun and was an great learning experience. However, I had one persistent problem that I definitely would change if I had the time to go back. My problem was making my website accessible to anything with a smaller resolution that 1920x1080. Images and background elements seemed to not appropriately scale or move with the screen size. Furthermore, I created a menu for phone users but was unable to make it appear in the front for users to press. I have no idea why it goes behind everything but I do think it might have something to do with the z-index. One thing I am very proud of in my site is my colour and shapes. It gives off the right theme and the right emotions.

                <br/><br/>Reflections on readings: Zook's reading examines the relationship between Information Technologies and spatial organization. This spatial qualities of information is understudied and can shed light on digital inequalities. The other reading by Ballatore discusses how search engines exert influence over the worlds digital landscape. Furthermore, the author argues that search engines are an gatekeeper as they decided what is and isn't visible to a user depending on their geographical location.
                
                <br/><br/>The readings makes me realize that there are probably so many things that I don't see because I live in South Africa. From a developers perspective the reading has also made me understand that if I were to create something on the web, it is very likely that majority of my viewership will be local and therefor I should be tailoring my content for a local audience. Moreover, the diagrams in the reading created an much better understanding of the digital divide in the world. It shocked me to see how little South Africa has an impact on the world wide web.</p>
