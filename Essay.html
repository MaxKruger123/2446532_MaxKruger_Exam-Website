        <h1>Analysis of Netflix's Webisite through the lens of UI and UX</h1>
        
       <p>Netflix is a streaming service that offers a subscription service in South Africa. Their website creates an incredibly good user experience through their UI but raises ethical concerns through addictive user behaviors. Firstly, Netflix is able to easily bring users to sign up through their well structured sign up pages that are simple, clear and comfortable for users. Secondly, the website's accessibility options have drastically improved to let visually, and hearing impaired people still watch their favorite shows through a changeable font size for captions. Lastly, Netflix creates personalized homepages to each profile according to a user's watch history. This gives users a much better experience and deviates from conventions used by other streaming services to create a more unique and effective user experience. However, the personalized algorithm raises ethical concerns with regards to addictive behaviors for users.

        <br/><br/>Netflix offers a subscription service to South Africans at R199 per month for users to watch their favorite shows. Following the basic principles of UI, Netflix does a fantastic job in creating a good user experience. This has allowed Netflix as a business to flourish and earn billions of dollars over the years. A touchpoint for Netflix's Website can be where users select their profile. Users are placed in the middle of the page to give a good understanding of what they must do. There is a big bold Text that asks the user “Who is watching?”, providing a clear understanding as to what users must do. The rest of the page is whitespace which creates a focus on the centre and gives clarity to the user. Furthermore, the page strives for simplicity. STUDIO’s webpage on the 14 basic design principles of UI states that simplicity allows for users to “easily understand and navigate the system” (According to UXPin (n.d.), there are several key principles of UI design, including "simplicity," "consistency," "visibility," and "feedback."), Netflix’s landing page successfully leaves out unnecessary elements on the screen and keeps the webpage simple to avoid confusion. Moreover, this page goes against convention. Most websites require users to log-in with an email and password that has 1 profile per user. Although Netflix has this too, Netflix saves their email and password and does not ask for it again unless users change their password. This skips an extra action that users would have to go through. Even though it is convention for sites to save emails and passwords to make users lives easier, they usually just autofill the fields and still require users to click sign in. 
        
        <br/><br/>This is where Netflix is able to create a better user experience. Not only do they skip the sign in step by automatically signing users in, but also allows a personalized experience for more than one profile under one account. This makes a customer's money more valuable since they can technically pay the amount for 1 subscription but have an entire family use it on different devices, personalized to each individual. With regards to Hassenzahl and Tractinsky 2nd aspect to UX, Netflix both falls short and excels in its contributing agents, user and context. Netflix’s accessibility has improved vastly over time. Closed captions and show descriptions are available in over 30 languages allowing people with impaired hearing to still enjoy amazing stories. Netflix browsing has also been made easy for people who struggle with vision. Tech Desk from The Indian Express states that for elderly people who may have glasses or imperfect eyes, watching a show with small subtitles may be difficult. This can be fixed by “increasing the size of the subtitles”  (Indian Express, 2020). Furthermore Tech Desk gives directions as to where the user can go to change this: “Account > Profile & Parental Controls > Subtitle Appearance” (Indian Express, 2020). This creates a much better user experience for those who have hearing or visual problems as they can still enjoy their favorite shows. However, the users context can influence their experience. Some of Netflix’s shows are region locked. This means that depending on the user's country, they may not be able to watch certain shows. For example, if a Netflix user lives in South Africa, they may not be able to access an American show. This is obviously frustrating for the user and results in a more negative user experience. 
        
        <br/><br/>Netflix’s expertise in UI design makes signing up extremely easy and quick and is a staple in their success today. Erica Shneider mentions that if the expectation of a user is high, and the “subjective value” (Shneider, 2023) is high then users will be more likely to follow through. She then gives an equation to Netflix’s success: “motivation = expectancy x value” (Shneider, 2023). Whilst signing up to Netflix, users are met with a screen to complete their profile. Centered, is text that says “step 1 of 3”. This makes users aware that the time this will take is short, and therefore increases expectancy. On the second screen users must choose their plan. Centered on the screen is text that reads “No commitments, cancel anytime”. This is smart because it gives the user a reason to try it. On the last screen they keep the steps in 3’s to keep the design engaging and compact. They provide users with the different plans information and give the users opportunity to opt out. This design makes certain that users are met with the last screen and are not interfered with if they wish to leave. The process to sign up to Netflix is fast, efficient and makes sure that users know what they are signing up for without hiding anything. Overall Netflix’s sign up creates an amazing first impression and creates a good user experience.
        
       <br/><br/> Netflix utilizes many conventions used on other streaming services, but also deviates from the norm to create a more unique and effective user experience. Just like other streaming services Netflix has a large video that plays on their homepage that features new or recommended shows. Netflix also autoplays trailers and has thumbnails for all their shows. These are all conventions that are considered the norm for streaming services. Mailloux states that “Conventions are not static norms, but living and evolving practices.” (Mailloux, 1983). As such, Netflix has also deviated from the norm in order to create an overall better user experience. Netflix has an extremely complex personalization algorithm that is unique to each profile that fits the needs of the user. It utilizes the users previously watched shows to recommend new shows that they are likely to enjoy. Furthermore, Netflix also has original content. Netflix heavily invests in creating new shows that are completely unique to their platform and are not available anywhere else. These deviations from the norm have helped Netflix create a more effective and unique user experience. By personalizing content and recommending new shows to users, and producing original content, Netflix is able to differentiate themselves from their competitors and create a completely different user experience that is tailored to the preferences and needs of the user.
        
        <br/><br/>Once you have created a Netflix account and are ready to watch shows, you are presented with your own homepage. Netflix uses horizontal sliders with headings such as “Trending Now”. In each horizontal slider there are thumbnails to different show’s, that when selected, the UI responds with the thumbnail slightly enlarging and playing the show's trailer. Users can then press a play button, an add to list button and an like button. These all let Netflix understand what the user likes and dislikes so that it can create a more tailored experience for the user. It takes users 2 clicks to watch a show and requires non-trivial effort. As shown by the thumbnails and buttons, their interaction design is responsive which enables users to traverse their system quickly and easily. Moreover, the interactions responses do not change when users are using a different device like an iPad or a Smart TV. This keeps users' expectations the same and makes sure that the site’s responses do not respond in a random fashion. Overall, the interaction design used for Netflix’s Website is responsive, does not respond in a completely random fashion, requires non-trivial effort and modifies text and images to let the user understand what to do and where they will be going.
        
        <br/><br/>Netflix has ethical concerns with regards to binge-watching and time spent on their platform. It is designed for people to sit and watch an entire season to become addicted to their shows from any location. This encourages people to rather watch Netflix and disregard their responsibilities, which leads to addictive behaviors. Firstly, Netflix releases shows on a season basis rather than an episode per week. This means that 8 - 12 episodes are released at one time. This encourages users to Binge-Watch content, especially if the user has been waiting for a new season to release. Not only this but built in their interaction design, there is an autoplay feature that starts the next episode without the user having to do anything. This makes their design require non-trivial effort which in text-books is better for their design but raises ethical concern. This can create addictive behaviors where users would rather spend time watching Netflix than spend their time on their responsibilities. Secondly, Netflix’s algorithms are complex and constantly recommend new content to users that suit their viewing needs. Although this is great for user experience it can cause users to spend more time than they intended on the platform as they continue to watch recommended content. Lastly, their platform is designed to be used on any platform making it easy for users to access it from any location at any time. This ease of access can make it difficult for users to take breaks from watching their favorite shows. Netflic’s design is not inherently addictive. However, by encouraging users to keep watching content through recommended content and the autoplay features can cause users to spend too much time on the platform even if they know they shouldn't, leading to addictive behaviors.
        
        <br/><br/>In conclusion, Netflix's website strives for simplicity and clarity for users to easily navigate through their pages and sign up while smartly making sure that the user can opt out at any time. Their accessibility options allow for the needs of different users that are impaired in some way to still be able to enjoy their service. Netflix deviates from streaming service convention by creating an unique and personalized experience through a smart algorithm that constantly recommends new and similar content based on what they previously watched. However, the auto-play feature alongside the personalization algorithm raises ethical concerns that may lead users to spend too much time on their platform without taking a break (binge-watching), leaving them to possibly disregard their responsibilities and become addicted to the platform.

        <h1>Exam Critical Essay of AI and Algorithmic Culture</h1>

        <p>The recent swift development in different AI systems pose many different risks to both humans and society. Firstly, through exploited labor chatGPT has already left workers with severe mental health issues. Secondly, AI raises ethical concerns due to the concentration of AI development in richer countries that can be bargained off to poorer countries for political control and thus widening the digital gap. Thirdly, AI has the potential to control nuclear weapons and defense systems in the US and Soviet Union.  Although AI has helped develop tools for everyday use to make our lives easier I still believe that making AI safety an global priority alongside pandemics and nuclear weapons is essential for our future.




            <br/><br/>“Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war” is a statement released by the CAIS to create a common idea and knowledge for the expanding number of experts in the field of AI (Statement on AI Risk: Cais 2020). The statement also strives to overcome the risks of AI and create more discussion on the topic. The CAIS develops “foundational benchmarks” and “methods” that can improve AI safety by directly tackling the technical challenges that are involved in developing AI to minimize AI risk (Statement on AI Risk: Cais 2020). The CAIS defines AI risk by explaining 8 different areas in which AI could cause issues. A few of these examples: First, through “Weaponization”, Malicious actors can remodel AI to become destructive (Statement on AI Risk: Cais 2020). In recent years there are already examples of AI being used to aid aerial combat for military pilots. Furthermore, easy access to powerful AI increases the risk of malicious users being able to repurpose them for destructive use. Second, through “Misinformation,” AI can be used to promote certain political beliefs and ideologies that may sway individuals to either end of the spectrum (Statement on AI Risk: Cais 2020). Lastly, through “Proxy Gaming,” AI could be trained with faulty objectives that would cause the AI to find different ways to achieve its objective at the expense of societal and individual values (Statement on AI Risk: Cais 2020). 
            
            
            <br/><br/>The statement released is extremely broad and only covers the “extinction” of the human race (Statement on AI Risk: Cais 2020). Although I agree that this is a future risk, there are already current issues that pose physical and mental threats to those involved in the development of AI. ChatGPT is a free-to-use AI language model on the internet that has had a profound impact on the world over the last year. Sama, a US-based data labeling company provided OpenAI with laborers that were tasked with browsing the darkest parts of the web and flagging them to help train ChatGPT. These workers reportedly read 150 - 250 text passages of extremely disturbing content that has left them physically and mentally tolled (Paul, 2023). In order to develop a smarter AI they had to exploit laborers' mental health. Furthermore, I believe that these workers were under-compensated only being paid up to 2 dollars an hour for insufferable work. Therefore, AI should become a global priority as it is harming the well-being of those involved in its development. 
            
            
            <br/><br/>There seems to be a common trend in AI safety development where the focus is preventing AI from overpowering humans in the future, but there are still many present issues and risks. The risks of AI are also extremely prevalent in the global south. Countries like the US have far superior technology than continents like Africa and can bargain for political control by offering advanced AI to these less-developed countries. This not only raises ethical concerns since the AI is developed and designed for the global north and will now be used in a completely different social and cultural context, but also raises the potential to exacerbate already existing digital inequalities and further embed notions of digital colonialism in the global south. COVID-19 has also largely impacted the global south due to the majority of learning at the time being shifted online. Most individuals on the African continent do not have access to either a smartphone or an internet connection. This means that in 2020 and 2021 the education system had a crash and many students were left behind, further increasing the educational gap and digital inequalities. Thus, the use of AI should be a “global priority” as AI has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and it created a further technological divide. 
            
            
            <br/><br/> AI already shapes our lives and we are unaware. We browse apps such as Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, which all have AI integrated into them. When you are browsing the Youtube homepage there is a recommendation system that is controlled by AI that constantly tracks what you watch, and what you might like to watch next . Facebook listens to our conversations from our cell phones which in return appear on our “recommended” list. The presence of AI fuels our entertainment in modern times. 
            
            
            <br/><br/> However, AI has had its biggest impact on the internet in a variety of ways and has great benefits. AI is able to create websites from scratch, not only saving a lot of time for developers but also eliminating the need for people to hire website designers. Some AI has completely taken over customer support on websites. AI driven customer support enables a better and faster user experience for those facing problems on certain websites. Chatbots generate personalized messages that provide better for customers in finding the ideal solution to their specific problem. Furthermore, using chatbots and AI to aid in customer service also reduces the strain on staff in a business (Paul, 2023). AI has also improved our lifestyles with the implementation of AI-based assistants such as Siri and Cortana that interact with our smartphones and other devices (Paul, 2023).
            
            
            <br/><br/>Although these AI developments have aided us in everyday life and business efficiency, it also poses problems associated with tech powers such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. This is an issue as it disables the local communities from producing their own unique tech products. In 2018 South Africa started their very first unique smartphone brand that by 2020 was sold off because it was not sustainable. In South Africa we grow up using Google, Google classroom, iPhones, Samsungs, we use international technology and barely stray from it. We learn not to trust our own countries' tech because we are unable to develop them on the same level as the large tech powers. It will be a near impossible task to close the digital gap between richer and poorer countries. Therefore, the major tech powers pose an obstacle towards the emergence of AI in developing countries and must be a priority before the economic gap widens further.  
            
            <br/><br/>The current most famous AI that is completely free to use for anyone is ChatGPT. ChatGPT has drawn attention from all over the internet due to its capabilities as a Language model and its usefulness in everyday life. Its capabilities have been used to enhance customer support, help individuals with education, help designers with coding and so much more. But this AI has finally reached the point of being much smarter than any human. I believe that AI should be developed with the purpose of making certain aspects of life easier but not completely replacing these aspects. For example, it is useful in simplifying complex information, such as providing lists with bullet points, for convenience. If these aspects are replaced then it shouldn't be completely free to use for anyone, otherwise it gives the opportunity for malicious users to use an extremely powerful AI for the wrong reasons. There are already many examples of chatGPT being used for destructive purposes such as malware - ChatGPT can be used to mutate versions of malicious code in each call (Sharma, 2023). Thus, the safety of powerful AI should become a focus point as others can take advantage of its already useful aspects. 
            
            <br/><br/> One of the biggest risks of AI development is in automated weapons. The relationship between AI and nuclear weaponry is not a new discussion but is one that has to be had. The two first countries to see the potential that AI could have on nuclear weapons was the US and the Soviet Union (Unucpr, 2018). AI could play a huge role in the development and maintenance of their retaliatory capabilities (the capability to to respond to nuclear attacks) (Unucpr, 2018). It can boost the capability to detect enemy attacks and activate early warning systems (Unucpr, 2018). It even has the capability to fully automate air defense and water defense systems. Thus we can see the importance of making AI safe to use as a global priority alongside nuclear weapons.
            
            <br/><br/> In conclusion the CAIS released a statement where they deem the safety of AI to be as important as pandemics and nuclear weapons. I agree with this statement because there are major concerns and risks that arise with the swift development of AI. Through developing ChatGPT, laborers' mental health was exploited and they were scared because of the work they had to do to improve ChatGPT’s content filter. Furthermore, AI can be used to gain political control over poorer countries that risks deepening digital inequalities. Moreover, free availability to the public enables malicious users to use AI in a destructive manner. Although AI has advanced our lifestyles and improved our entertainment industry, it poses a risk to more serious matters that can potentially harm people and society and therefore should be considered a global priority alongside pandemics and nuclear weapons.
