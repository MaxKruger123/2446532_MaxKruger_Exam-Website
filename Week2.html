            <h1>  <span id="Week2heading">Week 2 Website Development Blog - HTML and Internet Histories</span></h1>
            <p> <br/><br/>HTML: Thanks to high school I had already gained experience with html using basic tags to create small websites. At first when I heard we would be using html I was excited! I have always enjoyed the programming process of creating, whether it be games or websites. Experimenting with html and after watching the lecture with Andre, it made me realise something that before would have completely slipped my mind. Exactly how important semantics are. Something that as you create a website you must always take into consideration if you want you website to be discoverable.

                <br/><br/><br/>Readings: After reading Lawson Bruce's "Why you should choose HTML5" it truly revealed to me just how important Semantics is. Simply using article or section tags make a website more accessible to an array of different software's and devices. The video “How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video.” proves how important using semantics is. As a blind reader the main speaker in the video was able to go through and browse an abundance of websites and even told us how she was able to order an product. She described the problems that arise without these tags and the confusion that can come to say a blind user on a website. Overall it was very interesting to see how certain people are affected by your decisions and code when creating a website.
                
                <br/><br/><br/>Internet histories: Seeing how the internet has developed truly made me realise how quickly humanity has developed some technologies to make life easier for everyone. It makes me think about how much faster AI is being developed now  with the introduction to ChatGPT and how it is being incorporated into other websites. Even governments are using AI to find certain opinions on social media that may aid their decisions on the country. This puts into perspective how we may very well live in a completely different world in just a few years and I look forward to it. Lastly it is interesting to see just how competitive the space of the internet is. The section on browser wars was fun to listen to because I have also changed my default browser a few times. And again in just a few years it will be even more competitive.</p>
